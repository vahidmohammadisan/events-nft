Eventf
Project Overview

Eventf is an Android app designed with a clean architecture to provide users with a seamless experience for discovering, participating in, and managing events. The app offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore a wide range of events, subscribe to their favorite ones, and even create NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) associated with the events they win.
Features
1. Event Listing

    Eventf provides users with an extensive list of upcoming events across various categories such as sports, entertainment, technology, and more.

2. Event Subscription

    Users can easily subscribe to events of their interest, ensuring they receive updates and notifications about their chosen events.

3. Event Participation

    Eventf allows users to participate in events they've subscribed to.

4. NFT Creation

    When users win an event, they have the exciting opportunity to create NFTs associated with their victory. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or participation in an event.

5. Wallet Integration

    The app seamlessly integrates with cryptocurrency wallets, enabling users to transfer, manage, and showcase their event-related NFTs.

Clean Architecture

Eventf is built using a clean architecture approach, ensuring separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability of the codebase. The architecture includes distinct layers such as:

    Presentation Layer: Handles user interfaces and interactions.
    Domain Layer: Contains business logic and use cases.
    Data Layer: Manages data retrieval and storage.

The clean architecture also promotes modularity and testability, making it easier to extend and maintain the app.
